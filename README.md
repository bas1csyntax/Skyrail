SkyRail
==========
Kernal Layer proxy designed to link complex Minecraft servers.
--------------------------------------------------

SkyRail is a sophisticated kernal level server proxy and API designed mainly to teleport players between multiple Minecraft servers.

### Security warning

As your Minecraft servers have to run without authentication (online-mode=false) for SkyRail to work, this poses a new security risk. Users may connect to your servers directly, under any username they wish to use. The kick "If you wish to use IP forwarding, please enable it in your SkyRail config as well!" does not protect your servers.

To combat this, you need to restrict access to these servers for example with a firewall.
